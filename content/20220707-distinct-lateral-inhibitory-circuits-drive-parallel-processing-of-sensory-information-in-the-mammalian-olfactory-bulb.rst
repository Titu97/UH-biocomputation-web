Splitting sensory information into parallel pathways is a common strategy in
sensory systems. Yet, how circuits in these parallel pathways are composed to
maintain or even enhance the encoding of specific stimulus features is poorly
understood. Here, we have investigated the parallel pathways formed by mitral
and tufted cells of the olfactory system in mice and characterized the
emergence of feature selectivity in these cell types via distinct lateral
inhibitory circuits. We find differences in activity-dependent lateral
inhibition between mitral and tufted cells that likely reflect newly described
differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells.
Simulations show that these circuit-level differences allow mitral and tufted
cells to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, indicating
that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may
be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways.
