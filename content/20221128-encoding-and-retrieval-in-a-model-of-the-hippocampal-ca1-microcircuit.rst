This week on Journal Club session Eleonora Bernasconi will talk about a paper "Encoding and retrieval in a model of the hippocampal CA1 microcircuit".

------------

It has been proposed that the hippocampal theta rhythm (4- 7 Hz) can
contribute to memory formation by separating encoding (storage) and retrieval
of memories into different functional half- cycles (Hasselmo et al. (2002)
Neural Comput 14:793- 817). We investigate, via computer simulations,
the biophysical mechanisms by which storage and recall of spatio-temporal input
patterns are achieved by the CA1 microcircuitry. A model of the CA1
microcircuit is presented that uses biophysical representations of the major
cell types, including pyramidal (P) cells and four types of inhibitory
interneurons: basket (B) cells, axo-axonic (AA) cells, bistratified (BS) cells
and oriens lacunosum-moleculare (OLM) cells. Inputs to the network come from
the entorhinal cortex (EC), the CA3 Schaffer collaterals and medial septum. The
EC input provides the sensory information, whereas all other inputs provide
context and timing information. Septal input provides timing information for
phasing storage and recall. Storage is accomplished via a local STDP mediated
hetero-association of the EC input pattern and the incoming CA3 input pattern
on the CA1 pyramidal cell target synapses. The model simulates the timing of
firing of different hippocampal cell types relative to the theta rhythm in
anesthetized animals and proposes experimentally confirmed functional roles for
the different classes of inhibitory interneurons in the storage and recall
cycles (Klausberger et al., (2003, 2004) Nature 421:844- 848, Nat
Neurosci 7:41- 47). Measures of recall performance of new and
previously stored input patterns in the presence or absence of various
inhibitory interneurons are employed to quantitatively test the performance of
our model. Finally, the mean recall quality of the CA1 microcircuit is tested
as the number of stored patterns is increased.
