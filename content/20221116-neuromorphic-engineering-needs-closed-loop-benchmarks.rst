This week on Journal Club session Nik Dennler will talk about a paper "Neuromorphic Engineering Needs Closed-Loop Benchmarks".

------------

Neuromorphic engineering aims to build (autonomous) systems by mimicking
biological systems. It is motivated by the observation that biological
organisms- from algae to primates- excel in sensing their
environment, reacting promptly to their perils and opportunities. Furthermore,
they do so more resiliently than our most advanced machines, at a fraction of
the power consumption. It follows that the performance of neuromorphic systems
should be evaluated in terms of real-time operation, power consumption, and
resiliency to real-world perturbations and noise using task-relevant evaluation
metrics. Yet, following in the footsteps of conventional machine learning, most
neuromorphic benchmarks rely on recorded datasets that foster sensing accuracy
as the primary measure for performance. Sensing accuracy is but an arbitrary
proxy for the actual system's goal- taking a good decision in a
timely manner. Moreover, static datasets hinder our ability to study and
compare closed-loop sensing and control strategies that are central to survival
for biological organisms. This article makes the case for a renewed focus on
closed-loop benchmarks involving real-world tasks. Such benchmarks will be
crucial in developing and progressing neuromorphic Intelligence. The shift
towards dynamic real-world benchmarking tasks should usher in richer, more
resilient, and robust artificially intelligent systems in the future.
