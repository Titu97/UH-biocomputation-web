------------

The spread of the COVID-19 disease has prompted a need for immediate reaction
by governments to curb the pandemic. Many countries have adopted different
policies and studies are performed to understand the effect of each of the
policies on the growth rate of the infected cases. In this article, the data
about the policies taken by all countries at each date, and the effect of the
policies on the growth rate of the pandemic are used to build a model of the
pandemic's behavior. The model takes as input a set of policies and predicts
the growth rate of the pandemic. Then, a population-based multiobjective
optimization algorithm is developed, which uses the model to search through the
policy space and finds a set of policies that minimize the cost induced to the
society due to the policies and the growth rate of the pandemic. Because of the
complexity of the modeling problem and the uncertainty in measuring the growth
rate of the pandemic via the models, an ensemble learning algorithm is proposed
in this article to improve the performance of individual learning algorithms.
The ensemble consists of ten learning algorithms and a metamodel algorithm that
is built to predict the accuracy of each learning algorithm for a given data
record. The metamodel is a set of support vector machine (SVM) algorithms that
is used in the aggregation phase of the ensemble algorithm. Because there is
uncertainty in measuring the growth rate via the models, a landscape smoothing
operator is proposed in the optimization process, which aims at reducing
uncertainty. The algorithm is tested on open access data online and experiments
on the ensemble learning and the policy optimization algorithms are performed.
