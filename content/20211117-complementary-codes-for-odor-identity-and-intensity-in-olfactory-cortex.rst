------------

The ability to represent both stimulus identity and intensity is
fundamental for perception. Using large-scale population recordings in
awake mice, we find distinct coding strategies facilitate non-
interfering representations of odor identity and intensity in piriform
cortex. Simply knowing which neurons were activated is sufficient to
accurately represent odor identity, with no additional information
about identity provided by spike time or spike count. Decoding
analyses indicate that cortical odor representations are not sparse.
Odorant concentration had no systematic effect on spike counts,
indicating that rate cannot encode intensity. Instead, odor intensity
can be encoded by temporal features of the population response. We
found a subpopulation of rapid, largely concentration-invariant
responses was followed by another population of responses whose
latencies systematically decreased at higher concentrations. Cortical
inhibition transforms olfactory bulb output to sharpen these dynamics.
Our data therefore reveal complementary coding strategies that can
selectively represent distinct features of a stimulus.
