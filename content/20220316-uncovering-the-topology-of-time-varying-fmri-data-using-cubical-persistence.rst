Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a crucial technology
for gaining insights into cognitive processes in humans. Data amassed
from fMRI measurements result in volumetric data sets that vary over
time. However, analysing such data presents a challenge due to the
large degree of noise and person-to-person variation in how
information is represented in the brain. To address this challenge, we
present a novel topological approach that encodes each time point in
an fMRI data set as a persistence diagram of topological features,
i.e. high-dimensional voids present in the data. This representation
naturally does not rely on voxel-by-voxel correspondence and is robust
to noise. We show that these time-varying persistence diagrams can be
clustered to find meaningful groupings between participants, and that
they are also useful in studying within-subject brain state
trajectories of subjects performing a particular task. Here, we apply
both clustering and trajectory analysis techniques to a group of
participants watching the movie 'Partly Cloudy'. We observe
significant differences in both brain state trajectories and overall
topological activity between adults and children watching the same
movie.
