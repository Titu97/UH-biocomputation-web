This week on Journal Club session Manal Helal will talk about her current work on "Spinal Muscle Atrophy Disease Modelling as Bayesian Network".

------------

We investigate the molecular gene expressions studies and public databases for
disease modelling using Probabilistic Graphical Models and Bayesian Inference.
A case study on Spinal Muscle Atrophy Genome-Wide Association Study results is
modelled and analyzed. The genes up and down-regulated in 2 stages of the
disease development are linked to prior knowledge published in the public
domain and co-expressions network is created and analyzed. The Molecular
Pathways triggered by these genes are identified. The Bayesian inference
posteriors distributions are estimated using a variational analytical algorithm
and a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. Assumptions, limitations and
possible future work are concluded.
