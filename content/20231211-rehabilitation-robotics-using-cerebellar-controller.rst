On this week's Journal Club session, Mahsa Aliakbarzadeh will talk about her work in the talk entitled "Rehabilitation Robotics Using Cerebellar Controller".

------------

Stroke is a major cause of disability in adults. More than 15 million strokes occur every
year in the world, and more than 100,000 of these affect patients in the UK. Stroke
patients often have an impaired ability to control their upper limbs and need assistance
with every-day tasks. Relearning motor skills after stroke is like learning new motor
skills, but a problem for stroke survivors is that their impaired movements often restrict
the ability to use sensory feedback for re-learning. Rehabilitation robotics has shown
promise to augment the rehabilitation process and to offer feedback on performance.
However, the personalisation of the therapy to individual needs remains a major challenge
to date. I will use a computational model of the cerebellum that is to optimise robotic
rehabilitation for individual subjects. The cerebellum has been optimised throughout
vertebrate evolution to become an adaptive controller of biological skeletomuscular
structures that is unrivalled by any artificial adaptive motor control algorithm.
