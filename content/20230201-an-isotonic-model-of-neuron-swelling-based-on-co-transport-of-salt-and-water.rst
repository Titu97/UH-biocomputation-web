------------

Neurons spend most of their energy building ion gradients across the cell
membrane. During energy deprivation the neurons swell, and the concomitant
mixing of their ions is commonly assumed to lead towards a Donnan equilibrium,
at which the concentration gradients of all permeant ion species have the same
Nernst potential. This Donnan equilibrium, however, is not isotonic, as the
total concentration of solute will be greater inside than outside the neurons.
The present theoretical paper, in contrast, proposes that neurons follow a path
along which they swell quasi-isotonically by co-transporting water and ions.
The final neuronal volume on the path is taken that at which the concentration
of impermeant anions in the shrinking extracellular space equals that inside
the swelling neurons. At this final state, which is also a Donnan equilibrium,
all permeant ions can mix completely, and their Nernst potentials vanish. This
final state is isotonic and electroneutral, as are all intermediate states
along this path. The path is in principle reversible, and maximises the work of
mixing.
