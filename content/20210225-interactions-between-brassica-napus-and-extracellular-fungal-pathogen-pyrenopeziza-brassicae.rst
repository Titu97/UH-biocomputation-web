This week on Journal Club session Chinthani Karandeni Dewage will talk about a paper "Interactions between Brassica Napus and Extracellular Fungal Pathogen Pyrenopeziza Brassicae".

------------

Light leaf spot (Pyrenopeziza brassicae) is currently the most
damaging foliar disease on winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in the
UK. Deployment of cultivar resistance remains an important aspect of
effective management of the disease. Nevertheless, the genetic basis
of resistance remains poorly understood and no B. napus resistance (R)
genes against P. brassicae have been cloned. In this talk, I will be
presenting the findings from my research on host resistance against P.
brassicae and specific interactions in this pathosystem. New
possibilities offered by genomic approaches for rapid identification
of R genes and pathogenicity determinants will also be discussed.
