This week on Journal Club session Yi Sun will talk about a paper "Clustering Functional Data into Groups by Using Projections".

------------

We show that, in the functional data context, by appropriately exploiting the
functional nature of the data, it is possible to cluster the observations
asymptotically perfectly. We demonstrate that this level of performance can
sometimes be achieved by the k -means algorithm as long as the data are
projected on a carefully chosen finite dimensional space. In general, the
notion of an ideal cluster is not clearly defined. We derive our results in the
setting where the data come from two populations whose distributions differ at
least in terms of means, and where an ideal cluster corresponds to one of these
two populations. We propose an iterative algorithm to choose the projection
functions in a way that optimizes clustering performance, where, to avoid
peculiar solutions, we use a weighted least squares criterion. We apply our
iterative clustering procedure on simulated and real data, where we show that
it works well.
