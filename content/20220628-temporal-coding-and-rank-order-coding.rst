------------

It has been suggested that long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fibre (PF)
synapses enables a cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) to learn to recognise PF
activity patterns. We investigate the recognition of PF patterns that have been
stored by LTD of AMPA receptors in a multi- compartmental PC model with a
passive soma. We find that a corresponding artificial neural network
outperforms a PC model with active dendrites by an order of magnitude. Removal
of the dendritic ion channels leads to a further decrease in performance.
Another effect of the active dendrites is an afterhyperpolarization response to
novel PF patterns. Thus, the LTD based storage of PF patterns can lead to a
potentiated late PC response.
