This week on Journal Club session David Haydock will talk about a paper "EEG Microstates: Functional Significance and Short-Term Test-Retest Reliability" and his related work.

------------

EEG microstates, reflecting discrete topographical organization of the EEG
signal power, may have clinical relevance; however, their functional
significance and test-retest reliability remain unclear. To investigate the
functional significance of the canonical EEG microstate classes and their
pairwise transitions, and to establish their within-session test-retest
reliability, we recorded 36-channel EEGs in 20 healthy volunteers during three
eyes-closed conditions: mind-wandering, verbalization (silently repeating the
word 'square' every 2 s), and visualization (visualizing a square every 2 s).
Each condition lasted 3 min and the sequence of three conditions was repeated
four times (two runs of two sequence repetitions). The participants' alertness
and their sense of effort during the experiment were rated using
visual-analogue scales. The EEG data were 2\textendash 20 Hz bandpassfiltered
and analysed into the four canonical microstate classes: A, B, C, and D. EEG
microstate classes C and D were persistently more dominant than classes A and B
in all conditions. Of the first-order microstate param\- eters, average
microstate duration was most reliable. The duration of class D microstate was
longer during mindwandering (106.8 ms) than verbalization (102.2 ms) or
visualization (99.8 ms), with a concomitantly higher coverage (36.4\% vs.
34.7\% and 35.2\%), but otherwise there was no clear association of the four
microstate classes to particular mental states. The test-retest reliability was
higher at the beginning of each run, together with higher average alpha power
and subjective ratings of alertness. Only the transitions between classes C and
D (from C to D in particular) were significantly higher than what would be
expected from the respective micro\- states' occurrences. The transition
probabilities, however, did not distinguish between conditions, and their
testretest reliability was overall lower than that of the first-order
parameters such as duration and coverage. Further studies are needed to
establish the functional significance of the canonical EEG microstate classes.
This might be more fruitfully achieved by looking at their complex syntax
beyond pairwise transitions. To ensure greater testretest reliability of
microstate parameters, study designs should allow for shorter experimental runs
with regular breaks, particularly when using EEG microstates as clinical
biomarkers.
