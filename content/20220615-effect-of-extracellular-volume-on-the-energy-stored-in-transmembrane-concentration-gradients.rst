This week on Journal Club session Reinoud Maex will talk about a his paper "Effect of Extracellular Volume on the Energy Stored in Transmembrane Concentration Gradients".

------------

The amount of energy that can be retrieved from a concentration gradient across
a membrane separating two compartments depends on the relative size of the
compartments. Having a larger low-concentration compartment is in general
beneficial. It is shown here analytically that the retrieved energy further
increases when the high- concentration compartment shrinks during the mixing
process, and a general formula is derived for the energy when the ratio of
transported solvent to solute varies. These calculations are then applied to
the interstitial compartment of the brain, which is rich in Na+ and Cl- ions
and poor in K+. The reported shrinkage of this compartment, and swelling of the
neurons, during oxygen deprivation is shown to enhance the energy recovered
from NaCl entering the neurons. The slight loss of energy on the part of K+ can
be compensated for by the uptake of K+ ions by glial cells. In conclusion, the
present study proposes that the reported fluctuations in the size of the
interstitial compartment of the brain (expansion during sleep and contraction
during oxygen deprivation) optimize the amount of energy that neurons can store
in, and retrieve from, their ionic concentration gradients.
