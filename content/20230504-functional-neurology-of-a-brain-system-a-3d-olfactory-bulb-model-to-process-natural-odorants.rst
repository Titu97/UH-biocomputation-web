This week on Journal Club session Maria Psarrou will talk about a paper "Functional Neurology of a Brain System: A 3D Olfactory Bulb Model to Process Natural Odorants".

------------

The network of interactions between mitral and granule cells in the olfactory bulb is a
critical step in the processing of odor information underlying the neural basis of smell
perception. We are building the first computational model in 3 dimensions of this network
in order to analyze the rules for connectivity and function within it. , The initial
results indicate that this network can be modeled to simulate experimental results on the
activation of the olfactory bulb by natural odorants, providing a much more powerful
approach for 3D simulation of brain neurons and microcircuits.
