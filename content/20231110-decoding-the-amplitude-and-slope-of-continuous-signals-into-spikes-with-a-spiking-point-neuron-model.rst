In this study, we harness the signal processing potential of neurons, utilizing the
Izhikevich point neuron model to efficiently decode the slope or amplitude of fluctuating
continuous input signals. Using biophysically detailed compartmental neurons often
requires significant computational resources. We present a novel approach to create
behaviours and simulate these interactions in a lower-dimensional space, thereby reducing
computational requirements. We began by conducting an extensive search of the Izhikevich
parameter space, leading to the first significant outcome of our study: i) the
identification of optimal parameter sets for generating slope or amplitude detectors,
thereby achieving signal processing goals using neurons. Next, we compared the performance
of the slope detector we discovered with a biophysically detailed two-compartmental
pyramidal neuron model. Our findings revealed several key observations: ii) bursts
primarily occurred on the rising edges of similar input signals, iii) our slope detector
exhibited bidirectional slope detection capabilities, iv) variations in burst duration
encoded the magnitude of input slopes in a graded manner. Overall, our study demonstrates
the efficient and accurate simulation of dendrosomatic behaviours. Real-time applications
in robotics or neuromorphic hardware can utilize our approach. While biophysically
detailed compartmental neurons are compatible with such hardware, Izhikevich point neurons
are more efficient. This work has the potential to facilitate the simulation of such
interactions on a larger scale, encompassing a greater number of neurons and neuronal
connections for the same computational power.
