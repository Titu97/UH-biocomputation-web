------------

Climbing fibers (CFs) provide instructive signals driving cerebellar learning, but
mechanisms causing the variable CF responses in Purkinje cells (PCs) are not fully
understood. Using a new experimentally validated PC model, we unveil the ionic mechanisms
underlying CF-evoked distinct spike waveforms on different parts of the PC. We demonstrate
that voltage can gate both the amplitude and the spatial range of CF-evoked Ca2+ influx by
the availability of K+ currents. This makes the energy consumed during a complex spike
(CS) also voltage dependent. PC dendrites exhibit inhomogeneous excitability with
individual branches as computational units for CF input. The variability of somatic CSs
can be explained by voltage state, CF activation phase, and instantaneous CF firing rate.
Concurrent clustered synaptic inputs affect CSs by modulating dendritic responses in a
spatially precise way. The voltage- and branch-specific CF responses can increase
dendritic computational capacity and enable PCs to actively integrate CF signals.
