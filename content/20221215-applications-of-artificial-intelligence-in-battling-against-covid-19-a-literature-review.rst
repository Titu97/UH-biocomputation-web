This week on Journal Club session Mohammad Tayarani-Najaran will talk about a paper "Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Battling against Covid-19: A Literature Review".

------------

Colloquially known as coronavirus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that causes CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),
has become a matter of grave concern for every country around the world. The
rapid growth of the pandemic has wreaked havoc and prompted the need for
immediate reactions to curb the effects. To manage the problems, many research
in a variety of area of science have started studying the issue. Artificial
Intelligence is among the area of science that has found great applications in
tackling the problem in many aspects. Here, we perform an overview on the
applications of AI in a variety of fields including diagnosis of the disease
via different types of tests and symptoms, monitoring patients, identifying
severity of a patient, processing covid-19 related imaging tests, epidemiology,
pharmaceutical studies, etc. The aim of this paper is to perform a
comprehensive survey on the applications of AI in battling against the
difficulties the outbreak has caused. Thus we cover every way that AI
approaches have been employed and to cover all the research until the writing
of this paper. We try organize the works in a way that overall picture is
comprehensible. Such a picture, although full of details, is very helpful in
understand where AI sits in current pandemonium. We also tried to conclude the
paper with ideas on how the problems can be tackled in a better way and provide
some suggestions for future works.
