This week on Journal Club session Emil Dmitruk will talk about a paper "Brain
Network Dynamics during Working Memory Are Modulated by Dopamine and Diminished
in Schizophrenia".

------------

Dynamical brain state transitions are critical for flexible
working memory but the network mechanisms are incompletely understood.
Here, we show that working memory performance entails brain-wide
switching between activity states using a combination of functional
magnetic resonance imaging in healthy controls and individuals with
schizophrenia, pharmacological fMRI, genetic analyses and network
control theory. The stability of states relates to dopamine D1
receptor gene expression while state transitions are influenced by D2
receptor expression and pharmacological modulation. Individuals with
schizophrenia show altered network control properties, including a
more diverse energy landscape and decreased stability of working
memory representations. Our results demonstrate the relevance of
dopamine signaling for the steering of whole-brain network dynamics
during working memory and link these processes to schizophrenia
pathophysiology.
