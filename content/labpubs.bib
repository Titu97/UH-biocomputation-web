title = "Anovel HEOMGA Approach for Class Imbalance Problem in the Application of Customer Churn Prediction",
abstract = "Making class balance is essential when learning from highly skewed datasets; otherwise, a learner may classify all instances to a negative class, resulting in a high false-negative rate. As a result, a precise balancing strategy is required. Many researchers have investigated class imbalance using Machine Learning (ML) methods due to their powerful generalization performance and interpreting capabilities, comparing with random sampling techniques, to handle the problem of class imbalance in the preprocessing phase to facilitate learning process and improve performance results of learners. In this research, an effective method called HEOMGA is presented by combining Heterogeneous Euclidean-Overlap Metric (HEOM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for oversampling minority class. The HEOM is employed to define a fitness function for the GA. To assess the performance of the proposed HEOMGA method, three benchmark datasets from UCI repository in the domain of customer churn prediction are examined using three different ML learners and evaluated with three performance metrics. The experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to some popular oversample methods, such as SMOTE, ADASYN, G SMOTE, and Gaussian oversampling methods. The HEOMGA method significantly outperformed the other oversampling methods in terms of recall, G mean, and AUC when the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used.",

title = "Address-Event Signal Processing: Silicon Retina, Cochlea and Olfaction A Review",
abstract = "The nervous systems converts the physical quantities sensed by its primary receptors into trains of events that are then processed in the brain. The unmatched efficiency in information processing has long inspired engineers to seek brain-likeapproaches to sensing and signal processing. The key principle pursued in neuromorphic sensing is to shed the traditional approach of periodic sampling in favor of an the event-driven scheme that mimicks sampling as it occurs in the nervous system, where events are preferably emitted upon the change of the sensed stimulus. In this paper we highlight the advantages and challenges of event-based sensing and signal processing in the visual, auditory and olfactory domains. We also provide a survey of the literature covering neuromorphic sensing and signal processing in all three modalities. Our aim is to facilitate research in event-based sensing and signal processing by providing a comprehensive overview of the research performed previously as well as highlighting conceptual advantages, current progress and future challenges in the field.",

One of these, homeostatic structural plasticity, has been reported to restore activity in networks disrupted by peripheral lesions by altering their neuronal connectivity. While multiple lesion experiments have studied the changes in neurite morphology that underlie modifications of synapses in these networks, the underlying mechanisms that drive these changes are yet to be explained. Evidence suggests that neuronal activity modulates neurite morphology and may stimulate neurites to selective sprout or retract to restore network activity levels. We developed a new spiking network model of peripheral lesioning and accurately reproduced the characteristics of network repair after deafferentation that are reported in experiments to study the activity dependent growth regimes of neurites. To ensure that our simulations closely resemble the behaviour of networks in the brain, we model deafferentation in a biologically realistic balanced network model that exhibits low frequency Asynchronous Irregular (AI) activity as observed in cerebral cortex. Our simulation results indicate that the re-establishment of activity in neurons both within and outside the deprived region, the Lesion Projection Zone (LPZ), requires opposite activity dependent growth rules for excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic elements. Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they also contribute to the maintenance of activity levels in individual neurons. Furthermore, in our model, the directional formation of synapses that is observed in experiments requires that pre-synaptic excitatory and inhibitory elements also follow opposite growth rules. Lastly, we observe that our proposed structural plasticity growth rules and the inhibitory synaptic plasticity mechanism that also balances our AI network both contribute to the restoration of the network to pre-deafferentation stable activity levels.},

Due to the strong competition in the telecom industry market, companies use a business strategy to better understand their customers{\textquoteright} needs and measure their satisfaction. This helps telecom companies to improve their retention power and reduces the probability to churn. Knowing the reasons behind customer churn and the use of Machine Learning (ML) approaches for analyzing customers' information can be of great value for churn management. This paper aims to study the importance of Customer Churn Prediction (CCP) and recent research in the field of CCP. Challenges and open issues that need further research and development to CCP in the telecom sector are explored",

We developed a new spiking network model, simulations of which accurately reproduce network rewiring after peripheral lesions as reported in experiments, to study these activity dependent growth regimes of neurites. To ensure that our simulations closely resemble the behaviour of networks in the brain, we deafferent a biologically realistic network model that exhibits low frequency Asynchronous Irregular (AI) activity as observed in cerebral cortex. Our simulation results indicate that the re-establishment of activity in neurons both within and outside the deprived region, the Lesion Projection Zone (LPZ), requires opposite activity dependent growth rules for excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic elements. Analysis of these growth regimes indicates that they also contribute to the maintenance of activity levels in individual neurons. Furthermore, in our model, the directional formation of synapses that is observed in experiments requires that pre-synaptic excitatory and inhibitory elements also follow opposite growth rules. Lastly, we observe that our proposed model of homeostatic structural plasticity and the inhibitory synaptic plasticity mechanism that also balances our AI network are both necessary for successful rewiring of the network.},

title={Predicting voluntary movements from motor cortical activity with neuromorphic hardware},
year={2017},
volume={61},
number={2/3},
pages={5:1-5:12},
abstract={Neurons in the mammalian motor cortex encode physical parameters of voluntary movements during planning and execution of a motor task. Brain–machine interfaces can decode limb movements from the activity of these neurons in real time. One future goal is to control prosthetic devices in severely paralyzed patients or to restore communication if the ability to speak or make gestures is lost. Here, we implemented a spiking neural network that decodes movement intentions from the activity of individual neurons recorded in the motor cortex of a monkey. The network runs on neuromorphic hardware and performs its computations in a purely spike-based fashion. It incorporates an insect-brain-inspired, three-layer architecture with 176 neurons. Cortical signals are filtered using lateral inhibition, and the network is trained in a supervised fashion to predict two opposing directions of the monkey's arm reaching movement before the movement is carried out. Our network operates on the actual spikes that have been emitted by motor cortical neurons, without the need to construct intermediate nonspiking representations. Using a pseudo-population of 12 manually selected neurons, it reliably predicts the movement direction with an accuracy of 89.3% on data not encountered during model training, after only 100 training trials. Our results provide a proof of concept for the first-time use of a neuromorphic device for decoding movement intentions.},
