Evolutionary algorithms have been successfully employed to find the best structure for
many learning algorithms including neural networks. Due to their flexibility and promising
results, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have found their application in many image
processing applications. The structure of CNNs greatly affects the performance of these
algorithms both in terms of accuracy and computational cost, thus, finding the best
architecture for these networks is a crucial task before they are employed. In this paper,
we develop a genetic programming approach for the optimization of CNN structure in
diagnosing COVID-19 cases via X-ray images. A graph representation for CNN architecture is
proposed and evolutionary operators including crossover and mutation are specifically
designed for the proposed representation. The proposed architecture of CNNs is defined by
two sets of parameters, one is the skeleton which determines the arrangement of the
convolutional and pooling operators and their connections and one is the numerical
parameters of the operators which determine the properties of these operators like filter
size and kernel size. The proposed algorithm in this paper optimizes the skeleton and the
numerical parameters of the CNN architectures in a co-evolutionary scheme. The proposed
algorithm is used to identify covid-19 cases via X-ray images.
