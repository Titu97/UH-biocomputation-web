This week on Journal Club session Na Helian is going to introduce a paper titled “Boosting Ant Colony Optimization with Reptile Search Algorithm for Churn Prediction” which is written by our PhD student Ibrahim Al-Shourbaji.

------------

The telecommunications industry is greatly concerned about customer
churn due to dissatisfaction with service. This industry has started
investing in the development of machine learning (ML) models for churn
prediction to extract, examine and visualize their customers'
historical information from a vast amount of big data which will
assist to further understand customer needs and take appropriate
actions to control customer churn. However, the high-dimensionality of
the data has a large influence on the performance of the ML model, so
feature selection (FS) has been applied since it is a primary
preprocessing step. It improves the ML model's performance by
selecting salient features while reducing the computational time,
which can assist this sector in building effective prediction models.
This paper proposes a new FS approach ACO-RSA, that combines two
metaheuristic algorithms (MAs), namely, ant colony optimization (ACO)
and reptile search algorithm (RSA). In the developed ACO-RSA approach,
an ACO and RSA are integrated to choose an important subset of
features for churn prediction. The ACO-RSA approach is evaluated on
seven open-source customer churn prediction datasets, ten CEC 2019
test functions, and its performance is compared to particle swarm
optimization (PSO), multi verse optimizer (MVO) and grey wolf
optimizer (GWO), standard ACO and standard RSA. According to the
results along with statistical analysis, ACO-RSA is an effective and
superior approach compared to other competitor algorithms on most
datasets.
