On this week's Journal Club session, Pinaki Saha will talk about his work in the talk entitled "Olfaction prediction using 3DCNN and molecular electron density.".

------------

Olfaction, or the sense of smell, is a complex and poorly understood phenomenon that
involves the interaction of odorant molecules with olfactory receptors. The molecular
structure and properties of odorants determine their affinity and specificity for
different olfactory receptors, and thus their perceived odor quality and intensity. In
this presentation, I talk about a novel approach for olfaction prediction based on 3D
convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs) and promolecule electron density of odorant
molecules.
