This week on Journal Club session Stavros Anagnou will talk about a paper
"Spurious Normativity Enhances Learning of Compliance and Enforcement Behavior
in Artificial Agents".

------------

How do societies learn and maintain social norms? Here we use multiagent
reinforcement learning to investigate the learning dynamics of enforcement and
compliance behaviors. Artificial agents populate a foraging environment and
need to learn to avoid a poisonous berry. Agents learn to avoid eating
poisonous berries better when doing so is taboo, meaning the behavior is
punished by other agents. The taboo helps overcome a credit assignment problem
in discovering delayed health effects. Critically, introducing an additional
taboo, which results in punishment for eating a harmless berry, further
improves overall returns. This "silly rule" counterintuitively has a positive
effect because it gives agents more practice in learning rule enforcement. By
probing what individual agents have learned, we demonstrate that normative
behavior relies on a sequence of learned skills. Learning rule compliance
builds upon prior learning of rule enforcement by other agents. Our results
highlight the benefit of employing a multiagent reinforcement learning
computational model focused on learning to implement complex actions.
