This week on Journal Club session Na Helian will talk about her work done together with her PhD student Stiphen Chowdhury about "Feature Weighted Density-based Clustering".

------------

DBSCAN is arguably the most popular density-based clustering algorithm, and it
is capable of recovering non-spherical clusters. One of its main weaknesses is
that it treats all features equally. In this paper, we propose a density-based
clustering algorithm capable of calculating feature weights representing the
degree of relevance of each feature, which takes the density structure of the
data into account. First, we improve DBSCAN and introduce a new algorithm
called DBSCANR. DBSCANR reduces the number of parameters of DBSCAN to one. Then,
a new step is introduced to the clustering process of DBSCANR to iteratively
update feature weights based on the current partition of data. The feature
weights produced by the weighted version of the new clustering algorithm,
W-DBSCANR, measure the relevance of variables in a clustering and can be used
in feature selection in data mining applications where large and complex
real-world data are often involved. Experimental results on both artificial and
real-world data have shown that the new algorithms outperformed the DBSCAN type
algorithms in recovering clusters in data.
