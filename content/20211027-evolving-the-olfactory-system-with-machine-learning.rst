This week on Journal Club session Nik Dennler will talk about a paper "Evolving the Olfactory System with Machine Learning".

------------

The convergent evolution of the fly and mouse olfactory system led us
to ask whether the anatomic connectivity and functional logic of
olfactory circuits would evolve in artificial neural networks trained
to perform olfactory tasks. Artificial networks trained to classify
odor identity recapitulate the connectivity inherent in the olfactory
system. Input units are driven by a single receptor type, and units
driven by the same receptor converge to form a glomerulus. Glomeruli
exhibit sparse, unstructured connectivity onto a larger expansion
layer of Kenyon cells. When trained to both classify odor identity and
to impart innate valence onto odors, the network develops independent
pathways for identity and valence classification. Thus, the defining
features of fly and mouse olfactory systems also evolved in artificial
neural networks trained to perform olfactory tasks. This implies that
convergent evolution reflects an underlying logic rather than shared
developmental principles.
