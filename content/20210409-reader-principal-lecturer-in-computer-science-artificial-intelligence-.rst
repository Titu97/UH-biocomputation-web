Main duties and responsibilities
--------------------------------

The person appointed will be expected to make a significant contribution to the leadership of research in the department, including gaining research awards as Principal Investigator, the development of the research environment in the department and across the University, and publishing in peer reviewed journal articles and other internationally excellent or world-leading publications in education. To contribute to the development of, and supervise and teach on, doctoral programmes in the UK and internationally in relation to a wide spectrum of AI, especially emerging topics in AI. **Possible fields include, but are not limited to:**
 
- **Machine learning**: reinforcement learning, Deep Methods, statistical methods, large scale data modelling/intelligent processing and high-performance learning algorithms
- **Robotics**: embodied and/or cognitive robotics, HRI, robot safety, emotional/social robots, smart homes and sensors, sensor fusion, assistive robotics, soft robotics, adaptive or evolutionary robotic design
- **Biological and biophysical computation paradigms, systems biology, neural computation**
- **Complex Systems**: collective intelligence, adaptive, autonomous and multi-agent/robot systems, collective and swarm intelligence, social and market modelling, adaptive, evolutionary and unconventional computation
- **Mathematical Modelling**: statistical modelling, information-theoretic methods, compressive sensing, intelligent data visualization, multiscale models, optimization; causality
- **Emerging Topics in AI**: computer algebra and AI, topological methods (e.g. persistent homology), algebraic and category-theoretical methods in AI; modern topics in games and AI; quantum algorithms for AI
- **AI and applications**: financial modelling, AI and biology/physics/cognitive sciences
- **Foundations**: fundamental questions of intelligence and computation, emergence of life/intelligence, Artificial Life
 
Preference will be given to candidates that can deliver teaching to Level 7 in a selection of relevant subjects.
 
The appointee will also be expected to lead and develop taught modules in a range of computer science areas.  For appointees with the appropriate experience, there will be the possibility of taking up the role of Head of Subject Group within the department of Computer Science.


Skills and experience
---------------------

The appointee will strengthen the research culture in the Department by pursuing research as part of a larger research team, seeking external funding, publishing papers, supervising research students, and participating in commercial activity as appropriate. Therefore it is essential that candidates have a track record (e.g. in published, grant-funded research) in Computer Science. Additionally, experience of different types of assessment and higher education quality assurance is an essential requirement of this role.

Prior experience of developing modules and/or programmes of study in Computer Science is essential in addition to significant experience of operating in a UK HE Environment, or equivalent professional experience. Readers/Principal lecturers are expected to take on duties in the capacity of leader, and hence experience of academic leader, programme leadership and line management is desirable. Good interpersonal and presentation skills with proficiency in the English Language are essential along with the ability to manage conflicting demands and work to deadlines.

 
Qualifications required
-----------------------

Reader/Principal Lecturer applicants must hold a First Degree and a PhD in an appropriate area of Computer Science or an equivalent, relevant postgraduate professional qualifications.
 
In addition, the Reader/Principal Lecturer will be expected to contribute to the leadership and management academic programmes, as well as proactive participation in enterprise, knowledge transfer and/or research and scholarship in the School.  There are expectations of leadership and potentially supervisory oversight of groups of staff. Readers/Principal lecturers are also expected to contribute to the richness of the academic environment, through scholarly activity, support events, projects and activities, including open days, outreach, extra curricula initiatives, and potentially act as a representative of the School or University at national or international fora.
