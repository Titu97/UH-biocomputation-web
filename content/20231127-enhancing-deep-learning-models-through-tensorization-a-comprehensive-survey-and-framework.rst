On this week's Journal Club session, Manal Helal will talk about her under-review draft paper "Enhancing Deep Learning Models through Tensorization: A Comprehensive Survey and Framework".

------------

The burgeoning growth of public domain data and the increasing complexity of deep learning
model architectures have underscored the need for more efficient data representation and
analysis techniques. This paper is motivated by the work of (Helal, 2023) and aims to
present a comprehensive overview of tensorization. This transformative approach bridges
the gap between the inherently multidimensional nature of data and the simplified
2-dimensional matrices commonly used in linear algebra-based machine learning algorithms.
This paper explores the steps involved in tensorization, multidimensional data sources,
various multiway analysis methods employed, and the benefits of these approaches. A small
example of Blind Source Separation (BSS) is presented comparing 2-dimensional algorithms
and a multiway algorithm in Python. Results indicate that multiway analysis is more
expressive. Contrary to the intuition of the dimensionality curse, utilising
multidimensional datasets in their native form and applying multiway analysis methods
grounded in multilinear algebra reveal a profound capacity to capture intricate
interrelationships among various dimensions while, surprisingly, reducing the number of
model parameters and accelerating processing. A survey of the multi-away analysis methods
and integration with various Deep Neural Networks models is presented using case studies
in different application domains.
