------------

Electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to characterise microstates: sets of transient,
quasi-stable topographical maps of global EEG signal distributed across the scalp with an
average duration of 80 milliseconds. In recent years, sequence analysis of EEG microstates
has become of increased interest. Patterns in EEG microstate sequences have shown
meaningful relation to mental states, psychopathologies, neurodevelopmental stages, and
neurological diseases. Whilst EEG microstate syntax captures neural spatiotemporal
dynamics at the scalp, its relationship to large neural networks and their dynamics, as
well as associated cognitive processes/mental states, remain elusive. Functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) studies attempted to identify the relationship between EEG
microstates and the brain's intrinsic functional networks. Previously, we have used a
similar set of fMRI states referred to as co-activation patterns (CAPs) in an attempt to
investigate how the sequencing of EEG microstates may change alongside the sequencing of
fMRI states. Here instead, we correlate the fMRI time series with gradients - a set of
axes by which large scale cortical organisation operates along. The aim of the approach is
to interpolate the location of EEG microstates within an fMRI "gradient phase space", and
hence identify whether EEG microstates, and indeed EEG microstate sequences, have a
preference for a specific region of the gradient space.
