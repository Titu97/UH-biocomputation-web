This week on Journal Club session Volker Steuber will talk about a paper "A Cerebellar-Based Solution to the Nondeterministic Time Delay Problem in Robotic Control".

------------

The presence of computation and transmission-variable time delays
within a robotic control loop is a major cause of instability,
hindering safe human-robot interaction (HRI) under these
circumstances. Classical control theory has been adapted to counteract
the presence of such variable delays; however, the solutions provided
to date cannot cope with HRI robotics inherent features. The highly
nonlinear dynamics of HRI cobots (robots intended for human
interaction in collaborative tasks), together with the growing use of
flexible joints and elastic materials providing passive compliance,
prevent traditional control solutions from being applied. Conversely,
human motor control natively deals with low power actuators, nonlinear
dynamics, and variable transmission time delays. The cerebellum,
pivotal to human motor control, is able to predict motor commands by
correlating current and past sensorimotor signals, and to ultimately
compensate for the existing sensorimotor human delay (tens of
milliseconds). This work aims at bridging those inherent features of
cerebellar motor control and current robotic challenges\textemdash
namely, compliant control in the presence of variable sensorimotor
delays. We implement a cerebellar-like spiking neural network (SNN)
controller that is adaptive, compliant, and robust to variable
sensorimotor delays by replicating the cerebellar mechanisms that
embrace the presence of biological delays and allow motor learning and
adaptation.
