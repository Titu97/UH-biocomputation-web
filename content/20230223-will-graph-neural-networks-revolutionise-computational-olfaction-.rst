This week on Journal Club session Michael Schmuker will talk about a paper "Will Graph Neural Networks Revolutionise Computational Olfaction?".

How to predict the smell of a molecule given it's chemical structure? A group
of researchers around Google's Alex Wiltschko have used Graph Neural Networks
(GNN) to develop apparently outperform previous approaches to predict the smell
of an odorant [1]. They proposed the "Principal Odor Map" (POM): a latent space
which GNN learn from a data set of several thousand odorants. They show how the
POM improves prediction of scent [2], how it aligns with metabolic pathways
producing odors [3], and how it gives rise to the design of new mosquito
repellents [4]. The group has now launched a computational olfaction startup
[5]. In my talk I will introduce the GNN method and their approach to produce
the POM, summarise their results, and discuss how the performance of their
model compares to other established methods.
