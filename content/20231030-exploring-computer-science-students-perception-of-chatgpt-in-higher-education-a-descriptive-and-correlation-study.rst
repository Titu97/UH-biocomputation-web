On this week's Journal Club session, Harpreet Singh will talk about the paper entitled "Exploring Computer Science Students’ Perception of ChatGPT in Higher Education: A Descriptive and Correlation Study".

------------

ChatGPT is an emerging tool that can be employed in many activities including in
learning/teaching in universities. Like many other tools, it has its benefits and its
drawbacks. If used properly, it can improve learning, and if used irresponsibly, it can
have a negative impact on learning. The aim of this research is to study how ChatGPT can
be used in academia to improve teaching/learning activities. In this paper, we study
students’ opinions about how the tool can be used positively in learning activities. A
survey is conducted among 430 students of an MSc degree in computer science at the
University of Hertfordshire, UK, and their opinions about the tool are studied. The survey
tries to capture different aspects in which the tool can be employed in academia and the
ways in which it can harm or help students in learning activities. The findings suggest
that many students are familiar with the tool but do not regularly use it for academic
purposes. Moreover, students are skeptical of its positive impacts on learning and think
that universities should provide more vivid guidelines and better education on how and
where the tool can be used for learning activities. The students’ feedback responses are
analyzed and discussed and the authors’ opinions regarding the subject are presented. This
study shows that ChatGPT can be helpful in learning/teaching activities, but better
guidelines should be provided for the students in using the tool.
