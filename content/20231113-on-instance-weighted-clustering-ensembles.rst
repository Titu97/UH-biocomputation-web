On this week's Journal Club session, Paul Moggridge will talk about his conference paper entitled "On Instance Weighted Clustering Ensembles".

------------

Ensemble clustering is a technique which combines multiple clustering results, and
instance weighting is a technique which highlights important instances in a dataset. Both
techniques are known to enhance clustering performance and robustness. In this research,
ensembles and instance weighting are integrated with the spectral clustering algorithm. We
believe this is the first attempt at creating diversity in the generative mechanism using
density-based instance weighting for a spectral ensemble. The proposed approach is
empirically validated using synthetic datasets comparing against spectral and a spectral
ensemble with random instance weighting. Results show that using the instance weighted
sub-sampling approach as the generative mechanism for an ensemble of spectral clustering
leads to improved clustering performance on datasets with imbalanced clusters.
