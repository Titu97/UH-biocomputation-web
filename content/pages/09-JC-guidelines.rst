For the presenter
------------------

The time slot for the seminar is of 1 hour. Talks should be about 45 minutes long, the rest of the time is dedicated to questions.

You are encouraged to:

* present your own research rather than papers; 
* prepare a powerpoint presentation; 
* give general background/contextualization so that everyone can understand. 

The journal club is currently run in hybrid mode – the presenter may give their speech online or in person. 

Thank you and good luck with your speech :) 

For everyone
------------

The schedule of the presentations can be found `here <05-seminars.html>`_.
You will receive weekly emails inviting you to the seminars. 

The journal club is currently run in hybrid mode. Attendees may either join online or meet in a dedicated room on campus to facilitate discussions: 

* The online meetings will usually be held on Zoom. To join online, please use the link provided in the weekly emails.
* Look out for weekly emails where you can find the room number to attend on campus. 

Everyone is encouraged to ask questions – it is a good time to practice this skill! 

 
Thank you and enjoy the presentations :)
