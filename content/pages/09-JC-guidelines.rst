For the presenters
------------------

The time slot for the seminar is of 1 hour. Talks should be about 45 minutes long, the rest of the time is dedicated to questions.

You are encouraged to:

* present your own research rather than papers; 
* prepare a powerpoint presentation; 
* give general background/contextualization so that everyone can understand. 

The journal club is currently run in hybrid mode – the presenter is always online. 
Please make sure to enter the meeting 5 minutes early to make sure everything works properly. 

Thank you and good luck with your speech :) 

For everyone
------------

The schedule of the presentations can be found `here <05-seminars.html>`_.
I will send weekly emails to invite you to the seminars. 

The journal club is currently run in hybrid mode. The presenter is always online. Attendees may either join online or meet in a dedicated room on campus to facilitate discussions: 

* The online meetings will be held on Zoom. Please use the Zoom link provided in the weekly emails.
* Look out for weekly emails where I will communicate the room number to attend on campus. 

Everyone is encouraged to ask questions – it is a good time to practice this skill! 

 
Thank you and enjoy the presentations :)
