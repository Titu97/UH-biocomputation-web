"Sentiment Analysis Using BLSTM-ResNet on Textual Images".

------------

Sentiment Analysis is a popular classification problem where the degree of
emotion is analysed based on text. Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) are part
of various sentiment classification models, but their use has been limited to
one-dimensional (1D) convolution or shallow two-dimensional (2D) convolution.
The primary focus of this research is to use deep 2D-CNN architectures,
inspired by the popular computer vision model ResNet, to replace a shallow
2D-CNN in an existing BLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory)-2DCNN model.
This research investigates a new method for sentiment analysis which is an
amalgam of the practices popular in Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well
as Computer Vision, striving to extract opinions from a text by transforming
text into images. The text images are formed by transforming the word
embeddings matrix into a greyscale image with the help of BLSTM cell. Intensive
experiments have been conducted on the Sentiment140 dataset with our novel
BLSTM-ResNet model, which contains residual blocks with skip connections.
Several BLSTM-ResNet variants were tested to investigate the impact of network
depth and dataset size on sentiment detection. Moreover, two sets of residual
blocks are designed to form our shallow and deep BLSTM-ResNet models. Our best
shallow BLSTM-ResNet models have achieved 4.06\% and 3.43\% increases in
accuracy for dataset sizes 80,000 and 200,000 respectively, compared with the
baseline BLSTM-2DCNN model. In addition, an overall improvement is observed on
accuracy with every additional residual block in our shallow BLSTM-ResNet model
until accuracy saturates, and the same trend has been seen on the impact of
dataset size on the performance. Our deep BLSTM-ResNet models show the same
positive impact of network depth impact and dataset size on sentiment analysis.
Further investigation on the shallow and deep BLSTM-ResNet models shows that
deep BLSTM-ResNet outperforms shallow BLSTM-ResNet, in general.
