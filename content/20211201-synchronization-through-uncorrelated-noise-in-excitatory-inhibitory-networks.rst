------------

Gamma rhythms play a major role in many different processes in the
brain, such as attention, working memory and sensory processing. While
typically considered detrimental, counterintuitively noise can
sometimes have beneficial effects on communication and information
transfer. Recently, Meng and Riecke showed that synchronization of
interacting networks of inhibitory neurons in the gamma band increases
while synchronization within these networks decreases when neurons are
subject to uncorrelated noise. However, experimental and modeling
studies point towards an important role of the pyramidal-interneuronal
network gamma (PING) mechanism in the cortex. Therefore, we
investigated the effect of uncorrelated noise on the communication
between excitatory-inhibitory networks producing gamma oscillations
via a PING mechanism. Our results suggest that synaptic noise can have
a supporting role in facilitating inter-regional communication and
that noise-induced synchronization between networks is generated via a
different mechanism than when synchronization is mediated by strong
synaptic coupling. Noise-induced synchronization is achieved by
lowering synchronization within networks which allows the respective
other network to impose its own gamma rhythm resulting in
synchronization between networks.
