This week on Journal Club session Olga Tveretina will talk about her work on "Complexity of the Reachability and Mortality Problems for Hybrid Dynamical Systems",

------------

The mortality problem for a given dynamical system S consists of determining
whether every trajectory of S eventually halts.  The mortality problem is
relevant to the field of program termination, and it has been studied in
different contexts and in different variants. Closely related to mortality is
the reachability problem: does exist a trajectory starting at a given initial
state which evolves to reach a given final state. Both problems are undecidable
in general, and they are only decidable for a limited number of classes of
hybrid dynamical systems.

My recent related work includes results on decidability of mortality and
reachability for some hybrid dynamical systems on manifolds [1, 2].  The
complexity of these problems has received less attention of the community than
the fundamental issue of their decidability. Studying the computational
complexity of the algorithms for deciding reachability and mortality problems
presented in [1, 2] is one of my current research focuses.

In my talk I will discuss the computational complexity of reachability and
mortality for the closely related systems, so-called Restricted Hierarchical
Hybrid Systems. These models have been studied by P. Bell, Sh. Chen, and L.
Jackson [3], and they are a useful tool for exploring the complexity of such
problems for other kinds of systems.

While the current aims are to improve understanding the boundary between
decidable and undecidable systems and their computational complexity, it is
worth mentioning that hybrid dynamical systems on manifolds have important
practical applications. Areas where surfaces arise include among others
biological systems (modelling processes on cell membranes), robotics (the
configuration space of a robotic arm) and learning algorithms (finding a
low-dimensional parameterization of high-dimensional data).
