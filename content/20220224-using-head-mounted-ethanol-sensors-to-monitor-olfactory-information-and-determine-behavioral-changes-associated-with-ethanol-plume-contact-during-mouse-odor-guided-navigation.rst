Olfaction guides navigation and decision-making in organisms from
multiple animal phyla. Understanding how animals use olfactory cues to
guide navigation is a complicated problem for two main reasons. First,
the sensory cues used to guide animals to the source of an odor
consist of volatile molecules, which form plumes. These plumes are
governed by turbulent air currents, resulting in an intermittent and
spatiotemporally varying olfactory signal. A second problem is that
the technologies for chemical quantification are cumbersome and cannot
be used to detect what the freely moving animal senses in real time.
Understanding how the olfactory system guides this behavior requires
knowing the sensory cues and the accompanying brain signals during
navigation. Here, we present a method for real-time monitoring of
olfactory information using low-cost, lightweight sensors that
robustly detect common solvent molecules, like alcohols, and can be
easily mounted on the heads of freely behaving mice engaged in odor-
guided navigation. To establish the accuracy and temporal response
properties of these sensors we compared their responses with those of
a photoionization detector (PID) to precisely controlled ethanol
stimuli. Ethanol-sensor recordings, deconvolved using a difference-of-
exponentials kernel, showed robust correlations with the PID signal at
behaviorally relevant time, frequency, and spatial scales.
Additionally, calcium imaging of odor responses from the olfactory
bulbs (OBs) of awake, head-fixed mice showed strong correlations with
ethanol plume contacts detected by these sensors. Finally, freely
behaving mice engaged in odor-guided navigation showed robust
behavioral changes such as speed reduction that corresponded to
ethanol plume contacts.
