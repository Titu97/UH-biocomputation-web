On this week's Journal Club session, Han Lu will talk about the preprint entitled "Interplay between homeostatic synaptic scaling and homeostatic structural plasticity maintains the robust firing rate of neural networks". 

Han is a Postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Freiburg, Germany. Her studies focus on the homeostatic structural plasticity of neuronal connectivity in
response to external stimulation, using both computational and experimental approaches.

Critical network states and neural plasticity are essential for flexible behavior in an
ever-changing environment, which allows for efficient information processing and
experience-based learning. Synaptic-weight-based Hebbian plasticity and homeostatic
synaptic scaling were considered the key players in enabling memory while stabilizing
network dynamics. However, spine-number-based structural plasticity is not consistently
reported as a homeostatic mechanism, leading to an insufficient under-standing of its
functional impact. Here, we combined live-cell microscopy of eGPF-tagged neurons in
organotypic entorhinal-hippocampal tissue cultures and computational modeling to study the
re-sponse of structural plasticity under activity perturbations and its interplay with
homeostatic synaptic scaling. By following individual dendritic segments, we demonstrated
that the inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission did not linearly regulate dendritic
spine density: Inhibition of AMPA receptors with a low concentration of
2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline (NBQX, 200 nM) sig-nificantly increased
the spine density while complete blockade of AMPA receptors with 50 ÂµM NBQX reduced spine
density. Motivated by these results, we established network simulations in which a
biphasic structural plasticity rule governs the activity-dependent formation of synapses.
We showed that this bi-phasic rule maintained neural activity homeostasis upon stimulation
and permitted both synapse formation and synapse loss, depending on the degree of activity
deprivation. Homeostatic synaptic scaling affected the recurrent connectivity, modulated
the network activity, and influenced the outcome of structural plasticity. It reduced
stimulation-triggered homeostatic synapse loss by downscaling synaptic weights; meanwhile,
it rescued silencing-induced synapse degeneration by am-plifying recurrent inputs via
upscaling to reactivate silent neurons. Their interplay explains divergent results
obtained in varied experimental settings. In summary, calcium-based synaptic scaling and
homeostatic structural plasticity rules compete and compensate one another other to
achieve an eco-nomical and robust control of firing rate homeostasis.
