This week on Journal Club session Mahsa Aliakbarzadeh will talk about a paper "On Robot Compliance: A Cerebellar Control Approach".

------------

The work presented here is a novel biological approach for the compliant
control of a robotic arm in real time (RT). We integrate a spiking cerebellar
network at the core of a feedback control loop performing torque-driven
control. The spiking cerebellar controller provides torque commands allowing
for accurate and coordinated arm movements. To compute these output motor
commands, the spiking cerebellar controller receives the robot's sensorial
signals, the robot's goal behavior, and an instructive signal. These input
signals are translated into a set of evolving spiking patterns representing
univocally a specific system state at every point of time. Spike-
timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is then supported, allowing for building
adaptive control. The spiking cerebellar controller continuously adapts the
torque commands provided to the robot from experience as STDP is deployed.
Adaptive torque commands, in turn, help the spiking cerebellar controller to
cope with built-in elastic elements within the robot's actuators mimicking
human muscles (inherently elastic). We propose a natural integration of a
bioinspired control scheme, based on the cerebellum, with a compliant robot. We
prove that our compliant approach outperforms the accuracy of the default
factory-installed position control in a set of tasks used for addressing
cerebellar motor behavior: controlling six degrees of freedom (DoF) in smooth
movements, fast ballistic movements, and unstructured scenario compliant
movements.
