How does neural activity generate perception? Finding the combinations of
spatial or temporal activityfeatures (such as neuron identity or latency) that
are consequential for perception remains challenging. We trained mice to
recognize synthetic odors constructed from parametrically defined patterns
ofoptogenetic activation, then measured perceptual changes during extensive and
controlled perturbationsacross spatiotemporal dimensions. We modeled
recognition as the matching of patterns to learnedtemplates. The templates that
best predicted recognition were sequences of spatially identified units,ordered
by latencies relative to each other (with minimal effects of sniff). Within
templates, individualunits contributed additively, with larger contributions
from earlier-activated units. Our syntheticapproach reveals the fundamental
logic of the olfactory code and provides a general framework fortesting links
between sensory activity and perception.
